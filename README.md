Collaborative Design Participation with Immersive Tech
# **Microchallenge- Collaborative Design Participation with Immersive Tech**
### *Dhrishya Ramadass and Jorge DLM*


### Objective: 
The objective of this intervention is to empower members of a community to actively participate in the design process of any new infrastructure, in this case, the roof (smokers, lunch eaters, phone call takers, for mental breakdowns, etc) by  the using Immersive technology technology. By employing a 3D scanner to capture the spati al dimensions of the roof area, followed by collaborative design sessions conducted on 2D, 3D, and extended reality (XR) platforms, we aim to facilitate inclusive and user-centric design iterations. 
The integration of AR technology enables users to preview and assess proposed designs directly within the physical space by scanning a QR code placed in a totem on the roof.

# **DAY 1**
We started the challenge by identifying our areas of interest and deciding that we want to use in a virtual space that can work as a collaborative space to learn and design.

We ideated various ways in which we can include users of a space can be involved in it's redesign and decided to work with the tools and softwares we have: 

- iPad
- Procreate
- Phone
- Polycam
- Meta Quest 3
- Gravity Sketch


# The process:
## Steps

## 1. Generating a scan of the roof

# DAY 2

We used tuesday to get input from our fellow students, including sketches and some of their thoughts about the experience.

By this time we had imported the 3D scan into Gravity Sketch, pairing it with downloaded Building info, we were able to place it in a semi-realistic environment so it was easier to just take screenshots and sketch over those.

# Day 3 

We used this day to refine the totem to have people vote on the results, this will be a key aspect of the collaborative effort of co-designing a new shadow structure for the roof.

We also asked some of our friends to now jump into Gravity Sketch, where we taught them the basics, and just let them have fun with it.

# Day 4

Lastly, we cleaned up and imported the models into Adobe Aero, placing them into position on the roof so the Augmented Reality experience for voters was there.



# Insights


This experiment helped us see how new processes for citizen participation for design of new infrastructure might work in the future.

The 3D scanning experience has still ways to go, but it's getting to the level where everybody could do it with a moderately good phone.

Gravity Sketch worked very well in terms of being able to import the scan, and people had a lot of fun sketching there too. From total CAD newbie to Experts, the other students relayed how this experience differed from other creative experience.

Adobe Aero presents a great opportunity to place digital designs in the real world, making the decision process for any citizen participation project better.


In general, this process we undertook is a basic representation of what future citizen participation could look like, underpinning what technology can do for us in processes that were previously not collaborative, and thus, less democratic.
